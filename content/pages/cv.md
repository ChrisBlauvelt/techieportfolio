          I've had the pleasure of working with Chris at an MSP during a large
          growth period. His commitment to the MSP's clients and his own work
          ethic was commendable. His IT and management skills were exceptional
          and he was not only knowledgeable but he was the SME for multiple
          software and hardware products. He never failed to deliver on anything
          asked of him.
