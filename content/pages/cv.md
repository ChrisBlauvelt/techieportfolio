      ## **Deployment & Project Engineer - 360 Smart Networks**


      ### **April 2022 - August 2024**


      I am grateful for the opportunity to have developed my technical expertise
      at 360, where I built upon my foundation in understanding interconnected
      systems. During my tenure, I gained extensive hands-on experience with a
      wide range of technologies from various manufacturers, including hardware
      and software solutions that operate on desktop and server operating
      systems, as well as networking infrastructure.


      I also had the opportunity to dive deep into Microsoft Office 365
      administration, developing expertise in areas such as Azure Single Sign-On
      (SSO) integrations, Microsoft Entra ID user management, and InTune policy
      management. Additionally, I gained exposure to other key technologies,
      including virtual firewalls, CRM/ERP software, and specialized solutions
      tailored to law firms, such as AutoCAD, SolidWorks, BlueBeam, and other
      architectural programs. This broad range of experience has equipped me
      with a unique understanding of how different systems interact and can be
      optimized for maximum efficiency.
