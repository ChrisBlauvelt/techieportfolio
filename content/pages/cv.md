      **Deployment & Project Engineer - 360 Smart Networks** 


      I greatly appreciate the opportunity that I was given to hone my
      background in technology that was rooted in a foundational love for the
      understaing of interconnected systems. While at 360, I gained a massive
      amount of experience with different manufactures of hardware and software,
      oprerating on either desktop to server operating systems, to networking! 



      Additionally, I was able to gain experience with nearly all aspects of
      Microsft Office 365 administration: from Azure SSO Integrations, to
      Microsoft Entra ID user management, and managing Intune policies.
      Additionally, I gained additional exposure to virtual firewalls, CRM / ERP
      software, software tailored to law firms, AutoCAD/SolidWorks/BlueBeam and
      other architectural programs and their installation and administration.
