## A Brief Background

> "The Linux philosophy is 'Laugh in the face of danger'. Oops. Wrong One. 'Do it yourself'. Yes, that's it" - Linus Torvalds

My journey into the world of technology begins  (and even continues in it's current state) thanks, largely, to Linus Torvalds himself, as his and Richard Stallman's unique melange of philosophy and computing struck a chord somewhere deep within me at age 13 when flashing a Linksys WRT54GL router with DD-WRT in order to create a Wi-Fi repeater, before such a technology was sold in a mainstream (and affordable) consumer package. 

## What Does That Have To Do With Honesty?

More than I ever could have imagined.  When I entered the IT field professionally, I quickly learned that advocating for, or mentioning "Linux", "Open-Source", or "FOSS" were nearly akin to calling yourself a leper. 



This was in a direct contradiction, in my mind, to what made me an asset, and why I was hired.  I have maintained a homelab for quite some time, and with the advent of SBC (single-board-computing, like the RaspberryPi), I was able to take my love of Linux and Tinkering and create affordable and small home servers, from a Pi-Hole (DNS Sinkhole for Network-Wide AdBlocking), to clustering of resources, as well as a deep knowledge of containerization (both Docker and LXC) being strengths that I boasted on my application to any tech job that I could apply for!

Throughout my days, I continued to hear people mis-characterize the true philosophy behind FOSS: Free and Open Source Software. Free as in freedom, the freedom to do what you wish with it. 



The fear to use a tool that one does not understand can often overcome the urge to do the right thing, and this is something that I do not intend to shy away from in my future endeavors. 



There is an enormous space for Open Source Software to help secure your home or business, without the added cost (both materially and in the form of your data) going straight to the giant corporations which already run so much of our lives.



I look forward to the opportunity to explain these benefits to you and your team, and I hope that you'll stay tuned for future, and hopefully lengthier, blog posts!
